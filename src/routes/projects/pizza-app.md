# Overview

Wanted to make a fun application to learn different things. What better way than making a pizza (think python make pizza example).

Created a SPA prototype to show how ordering a pizza can be fun and interactive. Using GreenSock and SVG sprites to allow user to drag and drop toppings onto a cheese pizza of their choosing. Using Svelte components and stores for easy state management.

# Highlight

Sprite Assets
Interaction
Price Calculation

# Assets

Using SVG sprites to limit the requests to the user. Using smart naming conventions to allow for small code and easy component state to display correct graphics.

# Interaction

Drag and drop animations using GreenSock and Svelte components. Allow users to drag a topping onto the pizza to add as well as click if added to remove toppings.

# Calculation

As the user changes the size and toppings of the pizza cost will be reactively updated keeping precise track of what is ready to be ordered.

# Learned

SVG sprites and how to use them in components. Using data-set to help pass naming conventions along to keep every thing in sync. Wanted to try making HTML details and summary modal for oder confirmation screen.
